# 👋 Hi, I'm Paolo

I'm a technical high-school student passionate about **applied computer science**, **C/C++ development on Linux**, and **high-performance software**.  
I focus on understanding how systems work internally, from low-level logic to complete solutions.

## 🔧 Core Skills

- **C and C++ (Linux + Clang + CMake)**  
  Writing clear, controlled, and high-performance code. I prefer working without tools that hide the underlying logic.

- **Performance and Real-Time Optimization**  
  Manual implementation of mathematical operations, custom array processing, and low-level optimization.  
  Experienced in pushing code from basic performance to very high frame rates.

- **Robotics and Embedded Systems**  
  Work with **ESP32**, **Arduino**, and **Raspberry Pi**, focusing on binary communication, firmware–software integration, and system behavior analysis.

- **Tools and Simulators Development**  
  Interested in building lightweight simulators, emulators, and development tools without complex user interfaces.

- **Python (support and prototyping)**  
  Used for scripting, automation, and small utilities that assist my C++ projects.

## 🎯 Goals

- Improve and refine C++ development on Linux.  
- Build efficient, minimalistic tools and simulators.  
- Continue working on robotics, optimization, and embedded-focused software.
